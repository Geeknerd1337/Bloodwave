# Bloodwave
A Repository for my schools Games Programming class written in a custom engine called LARC.

# LARC
Larc is an engine created by Dr. Ian Parberry fron the University of North Texas. You can view his work [here](https://ianparberry.com/). 

The engine source is not included, but it is an incredibly low-level implementation of the most basic necessities needed to make a game in DirectX12. The engine has many issues in the form it was given, but I have managed to extend the functionality and add basic features which were missing. This results in a slightly underwhelming looking game, but one rendered more interesting by the limitations it was made under.

# Gameplay
